-- Standings view. Displays current positions for players in the tournament
-- It is constructed from the join of two different subqueries.
-- First subquery returns wins count for each player
-- Second subquery returns loses count for each player
-- The resulting table calculates column `matches` by adding wins + loses
create view standings as
